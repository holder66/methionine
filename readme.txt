This app uses data from the USDA nutrients database (SR27 version) to provide information about the methionine and cysteine content of individual foods. Of the 8618 items in the USDA db, methionine data is available for 5191 (60%), and cysteine data for 5025 (58%).

Use the find field at the top (identified with a magnifying glass) to find specific foods. Enter a part of the name and hit "Return" to start the find. To cancel a find, use the "X".

 You can further refine your search with the "Filter by food group" button. Close the popover with the "X" to activate the filter.

To mark items as "favorites", touch the heart button on the right of each item. A solid red heart indicates a favorite.

Filter to show only favorites using the "Other filters" button at the bottom. This button also allows you to limit search results to items for which methionine and/or cysteine content is available.

The number at the right of each item gives the methionine content in mg per 100g, and the cysteine content below it. Touch the item to show contents for other quantities of the food item.

The nutrients tab shows the protein, carbs, fat, and water content for the food item, as well as the methionine/total protein fraction as a percent; similarly for the cysteine/protein fraction. The sum of the methionine and cysteine content is given, as well as their ratio.

The sort button in the bottom middle allows for sorting by methionine content, cysteine content, the sum of these two nutrients, or the ratio.
