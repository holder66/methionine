# methionine
A food nutrient database for methionine and cysteine content, based on Filemaker

Research shows that dietary methionine restriction inhibits growth of some cancers, and in experimental animals can increase healthy longevity.
Methionine, an amino acid and protein building block, tends to be found at high concentrations in animal-based foods.
Conversely, fruits and vegetables have low methionine concentrations. It has even been proposed that the health benefits of a vegan diet may be due to its inherently low methionine content, given that animal proteins are avoided.

To aid those who wish to reduce the methionine content of their diet, I've adapted the information provided in the USDA Nutrient Database, into an easy to use Filemaker database.
The database requires that Filemaker Go, version 13, be installed on your iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch. Filemaker Go 13 is free at the Apple App Store.
Install the .fmp12 file on your iOS device, either via iTunes, or by sending the file by email or message to your device, or with AirDrop.
