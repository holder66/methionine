# methionine
A food nutrient database for methionine, leucine, glycine, and cysteine content, based on Filemaker.

Research shows that dietary methionine restriction inhibits growth of some cancers, and in experimental animals can increase healthy longevity.
Methionine, an amino acid and protein building block, tends to be found at high concentrations in animal-based foods.
Conversely, fruits and vegetables have low methionine concentrations. It has even been proposed that the health benefits of a vegan diet may be due to its inherently low methionine content, given that animal proteins are avoided.

To aid those who wish to reduce the methionine content of their diet, I've adapted the information provided in the USDA Nutrient Database, into an easy to use Filemaker database. You can get concentrations for the amino acids methionine, leucine, glycine, and cysteine; total protein, carbohydrate, fat, and water; values for PRAL (Predicted Renal Acid Load), using either the usual formula or a more accurate formula based on actual concentrations of sulfur-containing amino acids. Besides data for the standard 100g amount for each of the over 8000 food items included in the USDA database, there are also derived amounts for the quantities of each food item that are in daily use.

Nutrient content can also be displayed in bar chart form.

There are several tools for filtering food items, for sorting, for finding specific foods, and for marking items as "favorites".
 
The database requires that Filemaker Go, version 13 or later, be installed on your iOS device (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch. Filemaker Go 15, the current version, is free at the Apple App Store.

In the web browser on your iOS device, touch the filename USDASR27methionine_v8_2.fmp12. In the page that opens, touch the "view the full file." After the file finishes downloading, open it in FileMaker Go.
